# Pandas-Analysis
In this analysis using Python, Pandas and Jupyter Lab, data sets on 15 schools and 39,170 students were merged to analyze the overall passing rate of students based on school size, spending per student, school type, and year of student. 

Overall, 65% of all the students passed both math and reading. 

Schools in the lowest spending range ($0-585) had the highest rate of overall passing while schools in the highest spending range ($645-680) had the lowest rate of overall passing. 

Additionally, schools with the largest student population had a lower rate of overall passing than smaller schools.
